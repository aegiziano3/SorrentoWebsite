            <h2>About the apartment</h2>
            <p>
                On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.
                Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants,
                cafes, a
                chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the
                beach.
                It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a
                sun
                drenched, tree-filled private garden.
                A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized
                bedroom
                and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to
                stretch
                out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the perfect place for a home away from home.
